Things that are not implemented: 
	- Displaying game info (missiles, status, etc.)
	- Displaying opposing player's name or game name (until a winner is 	  determined, that is).
	- A pretty UI.

Directions:
	- Enter player name. This will stay with you the entire session.
	- Click "New Game" button or scroll through the list and click until you find 	  a joinable game.
	- The game will tell you when you are waiting or when it's your turn via a 	  Toast. More information is displayed in the Logcat.
